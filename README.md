## Introduction

This project demonstrates various ETL tasks using Microsoft SSIS. Each problem focuses on a different aspect of data integration, utilizing SSIS to solve these tasks efficiently.

---

## Problem 1: Consuming a REST API

### Problem Statement

Consume any REST API and load the response to the database. You donâ€™t have to load all the response fields; 3 or 4 is sufficient. For this example, we use a REST API that searches for universities. We create a database table named `University` with three columns: `name`, `country`, and `alpha_two_code`, and load those fields only.

### Solution

To solve this problem, we use a Script Task in SSIS and write a C# script to consume the REST API, extract the necessary fields, and load the data into the SQL Server database.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Set Up SSIS Package

1. **Create a new SSIS package:**
   - Open SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Create a new Integration Services Project.
   - Right-click on the "SSIS Packages" folder and select "New SSIS Package".

2. **Add a Script Task to the Control Flow:**
   - Drag and drop a "Script Task" from the SSIS Toolbox onto the Control Flow design surface.

3. **Configure the Script Task:**
   - Double-click on the Script Task to open the Script Task Editor.
   - In the Script Task Editor, click on "Edit Script".

#### C# Code Explanation

The script starts by setting up namespaces and defining the `College` class, which maps to the structure of the JSON response from the API. It then configures security protocols for web requests and makes a request to the API URL `http://universities.hipolabs.com/search`. The JSON response is deserialized into a list of `College` objects. For each `College` object, the script connects to the SQL Server database and inserts the data into the `University` table. If an error occurs, it logs the error to a file.

### Prerequisites

Before running the SSIS package, ensure you have the following:

- SQL Server installed and configured.
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) installed.
- Access to a REST API (for the example, we use `http://universities.hipolabs.com/search`).
