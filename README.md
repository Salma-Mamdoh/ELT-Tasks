## Introduction

This project demonstrates various ETL tasks using Microsoft SSIS. Each problem focuses on a different aspect of data integration, utilizing SSIS to solve these tasks efficiently.

---

## Problem 1: Consuming a REST API

### Problem Statement

Consume any REST API and load the response to the database. You donâ€™t have to load all the response fields; 3 or 4 is sufficient. For this example, we use a REST API that searches for universities. We create a database table named `University` with three columns: `name`, `country`, and `alpha_two_code`, and load those fields only.

### Solution

To solve this problem, we use a Script Task in SSIS and write a C# script to consume the REST API, extract the necessary fields, and load the data into the SQL Server database.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Set Up SSIS Package

-**Create a new SSIS package and add a Script Task; then click "Edit Script" to configure the C# script.**

#### C# Code Explanation

The script starts by setting up namespaces and defining the `College` class, which maps to the structure of the JSON response from the API. It then configures security protocols for web requests and makes a request to the API URL `http://universities.hipolabs.com/search`. The JSON response is deserialized into a list of `College` objects. For each `College` object, the script connects to the SQL Server database and inserts the data into the `University` table. If an error occurs, it logs the error to a file.

## Problem 2: Implementing SCD Type 4 with Incremental Load

### Problem Statement

Implement SCD type 4 for the `Employee_Q2` source table, with fields City and Email, and read the source data using incremental load.

### Solution

To implement SCD Type 4 and incremental load, we'll create two target tables: `Employee_Latest` and `Employee_History`. These tables will store the latest version and history of changes for each employee.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create Target Tables:**
   - **Employee_Latest:** ID, Name, City, Email, Update_Date (datetime).
   - **Employee_History:** History_ID, ID, Name, City, Email, Update_Date (datetime), End_Date (datetime).

2. **SSIS Package Overview:**
   - Extract data from `Employee_Q2`.
   - Use Lookup Transformation to match data with `Employee_Latest`.
   - Split data into new and updated records.
   - Set `Update_Date` and manage historical changes.
   - Insert new records into `Employee_Latest` and update `Employee_History`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - **Incremental Load:** Efficiently processes new and updated data.
   - **SCD Type 4 Handling:** Maintains current and historical data for each employee.
   - **SSIS Components:** Utilizes Lookup Transformation, Conditional Split, Derived Column, and OLE DB Command.
